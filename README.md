Plugging random things into your laptop's USB port is okay as long as you do it Cybervigilantly. Please fork the code and weaponize the crap out of this.

## Cybervoice synth

So apparently you can make lame voice synthesis on a puny arduino nano. 

Code has been stolen from [https://code.google.com/archive/p/tinkerit/](https://code.google.com/archive/p/tinkerit/)

Paper thing stolen from [http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2016/06/ric_papertoy.pdf](http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2016/06/ric_papertoy.pdf)

Original code apparently inspired from [http://www.apple-iigs.info/newdoc/sam.pdf](http://www.apple-iigs.info/newdoc/sam.pdf)

0. Just connect like so and stuff everything inside Ric's inviting hole.
